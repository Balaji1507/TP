    <p class="p1">Veerapandiya Kattabomman was an 18th-century 
        Palayakarrar and king of Panchalankurichi in 
        Tamil Nadu, India. He fought British East India
         Company He was captured by the British with the 
         help of the ruler of the kingdom of Pudukottai, 
         Vijaya Raghunatha Tondaiman, and at the age of 39
          he was hanged at Kayathar on 16 October 1799.</p>
    <h3 class="H2">Early life</h3>
    <p class="p2">Veerapandiya Kattabomman was born to Jagaveera Kattabomman 
        and Arumugathammal, with his father Jagaveera being the polygar
         of Panchalankurichi. He belonged to the Bommu and Aathi Kattabomman 
         clans of Panchalankurichi. He inherited his father's position 
         as the polygar of Panchalankurichi when he turned 30, becoming 
         the 47th polygar of the village.</p>
    <h3 >Background</h3>
    <p>Veerapandiya as a polygar retained the right to collect taxes and recruit 
        soldiers in his domain, the British viewed the polygars as illegitimate 
        rulers and wanted to end their taxation powers, and curtail their power 
        and influence. To this end they introduced a new tax policy through which 
        they intended to completely bypass the polygars and other intermediaries 
        during tax collection. Kattabomman saw this as an attempt to usurp his 
        sovereignty over his domain by the British and stopped paying them tributes 
        contending that his taxes ought to be waived due to the prolonged drought in
         his domain, whilst fighting against polygars allied with the British.
        In 1798 Kattabomman and the then Tirunelveli collector Jackson got into 
        a disagreement over left over taxes, when Kattabomman was able to meet 
        with Jackson three months later in Ramnathapuram, where there was an altercation 
        between company troops and the polygar resulting in the death of the deputy 
        commandant of the company's forces Clarke, Kattabomman was acquitted from this
        following an inquiry. In 1799 following his refusal to meet with the collector,
         the British sent an armed force under Major. John Alexander Bannerman</p>
        <h3>Fighting</h3>
        <p>Kattabomman had to make a stand at his fort in Panchalankurichi, largely unprepared, 
            although his forces were able to hold back the company troops initially, his fort 
            was incapable of taking on British artillery, so he withdrew from the fort into nearby 
            forests, fighting a guerilla campaign till his capture on October 1 1799 with the
            assistance of polygars allied to the British like Ettappan of Ettaiyapuram and the
            king of Pudukkottai Vijaya Raghunatha Thondaiman.</p>
        <h3>Arrest and Execution</h3> 
        <p>Following his capture, Kattabomman was interrogated for 15 days and sentenced to death. 
            He was hanged to death at Kayathar on 16 October 1799.His surviving relatives including 
            his deaf-mute brother Umaidurai were also arrested and locked up in the fort of Palayamkottai, 
            however Umaidurai escaped, joined up with other polygars and continued fighting the British. 
            After his defeat and capture in October 1801, he too was hanged along with the other polygars 
            who resisted the British, while the Panchalankurichi fort was razed to the ground, with its site
            ploughed over and planted with castor seeds, and its name expunged from all registers in the district.</p>
